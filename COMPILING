The Qt Creator IDE is used to create/debug Velocity.

==========

- WINDOWS
	While debugging, Velocity is compiled with 'Qt 4.8.1 for Desktop - MingGW (Qt SDK) Debug'.
	While compiling for release mode, Velocity is compiled with 'Qt 4.8.1 for Desktop - MingGW (Qt SDK) Release'.
	
	Tool Chain: 'Mingw as a GCC for Windows targets'
	
	WARNING: Botan must be found in the working directory of Velocity.exe for Velocity to successfully run. To obtain the Botan libraries, you have 2 options:
	
	1. Download the Botan sources from http://botan.randombit.net/download.html.
	2. Download 'Botan.dll' from http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?v5zpod1y170154w, if available.

When Velocity is done compiling for the first time, it will most likely fail. A bug with Qt seems to happen on line 79 of 'moc_gamerpicturedialog.cpp'.
To fix this, simply added 'struct ' before 'Title':

        case 3: _t->onTitleIDSearchReturn((*reinterpret_cast< QList<Title>(*)>(_a[1]))); break;
		
		to
		
		case 3: _t->onTitleIDSearchReturn((*reinterpret_cast< QList<struct Title>(*)>(_a[1]))); break;

Attempting to compile after this should be a successful compile.
